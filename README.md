Hi there! 👋🏻<br>
<br>
The future of Quality Assurance isn't just automation. It is Agentic Intelligence. I am a Lead QA and Educator dedicated to bridging the gap between traditional robust frameworks and the AI-driven future of testing.

What I Do:

Engineering Leadership: I lead teams in building high-performance testing frameworks for FinTech and Crypto sectors. I treat test code with the same rigor as production code. I am using Playwright and TypeScript and I am prioritizing scalability, maintainability, and speed.

Agentic QE Implementation: I push the boundaries of what's possible by leveraging AI agents. My focus is on creating autonomous testing loops that reduce maintenance overhead and increase coverage.

Community Impact: As the founder of "Intelligent Quality," I empower a community of 1,500+ engineers. I break down complex concepts into actionable strategies, teaching others how to survive and thrive in the era of AI.

The Foundation: My approach to quality is grounded in a decade of Civil Engineering experience. Having managed €100M projects, I understand that true scalability requires a solid foundation. I’ve pivoted that engineering mindset from physical infrastructure to digital ecosystems.
## **`Enhancing the Standard of Quality (QA Automation Lead)`**

🟢 Align Quality with Business Goals: Partnering with product managers and developers to create simple, clear quality strategies. This ensures the focus of our testing efforts on what matters most to the customers and the business.<br>
<br>
🟢 Bring Clarity to Complex Projects: Helping teams work together smoothly by leading quality efforts, ensuring everyone is aligned and clear on the goals, even across multiple teams.<br>
<br>
🟢 Build a Stronger Engineering Culture: Enjoy mentoring developers and QA professionals on best practices. This helps build a strong culture where everyone on the team feels responsible for quality.<br>
<br>
🟢 Increase Your Release Speed: Building modern, easy-to-use automated testing systems (for both the user interface and API) from scratch. This helps new features are released faster and with fewer bugs.<br>
<br>
🟢 Give Developers More Confidence: By adding automated tests into development pipeline (CI/CD), developers get instant feedback on their code, helping them move faster and with more confidence.<br>
